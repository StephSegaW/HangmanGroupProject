# This is the main module for the Hangman game.
# We can build it step by step, starting with the basic structure and then adding features incrementally later

# first let's write our features in our separate modules
# and then we can import them into our main module
# import time and drawing functions are in gamelogic_handling.py
# import random and os are in file_handling.py
# ui and userdata is handled in hangman.py



# ISSUE - you are welcome to fix
## in def main_menu, it does not loop back after input error. Example: user input - sdfjsalk, app closes and not return to main menu option




# Importing necessary modules into hangman.py
